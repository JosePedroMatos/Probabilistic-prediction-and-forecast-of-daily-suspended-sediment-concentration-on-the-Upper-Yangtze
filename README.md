Digital supplementary information to the paper "Probabilistic prediction and forecast of daily suspended sediment concentration on the Upper Yangtze", by José Pedro Matos, Marwan A. Hassan, Xi Xi Lu, and Mário J. Franca, submitted to the Journal of Geophysical Research - Earth Surface, 2018.

Requests for the base data used in the paper should be addressed to Prof. Lu Xi Xi. His contact can be found in the Supplementary Information of the paper.

A significant part of the code makes use of AMALGAM [Vrugt and Robinson, 2007; Vrugt et al., 2009] – a code prepared by Jasper Vrugt and available from his website at:
http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/jasper/software/
Adapatations will be made in the near future so that the code within this repository can be plugged into the original AMALGAM (to be obtained directly from Jasper Vrugt) and, thus, avoid its redistribution.
